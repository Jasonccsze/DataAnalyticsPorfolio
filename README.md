# DataAnalyticsPortfolio  
This repository contains my personal projects of data analysis.  
Tools: Microsoft Excel, BigQuery SQL workspace, RStudio, Tableau  
  
Project #01 - Is knowledge power?  
This is a case study to identify whether education can improve the quality of living, using World Development Indicators, an open data set provided by the World Bank.  
  
SQL queries are executed on BigQuery to generate a set of csv files containing long data, the csv files are then processed into wide data on RStudio. Finally, the data are cleaned using Excel and visualised using Tableau.
  
SQL script:  
#01 check_name.sql  
#02 check_indicator.sql  
#03 extract_indicator.sql  
#04 extract_data_1990.sql  
#05 extract_data_2011.sql  
#06 extract_data_edu.sql
